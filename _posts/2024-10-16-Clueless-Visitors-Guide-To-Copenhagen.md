## Before leaving the house

Have the following things, or be ready to get them after landing:

- Power plug adapter for types E (most common) and K (grounded)
- Umbrella
- Rain-friendly shoes (or an extra pair)
- Rain clothes
- Cold weather clothes
- A Google Maps route indicating the public transport option to get to the hotel (or just get a taxi if you're bougie)

## Intro to the area

Copenhagen is in a tiny corner of Denmark that gets close to Sweden.

Almost everything is in English or can be deduced by context clues. No Danish skills needed.

SFO has nonstop flights to CPH through SAS (Scandinavian Airlines). Most flights are layovers, so be sure to browse a bit.
The current nonstop flight planes are SAS 936 (SFO -> CPH) and SAS 935 (CPH -> SFO).

![SAS-935 CPH to SFO](https://f002.backblazeb2.com/file/gigglekeklol/sas-935.png)

The flight is 10.5-11 hours.

As of 2024-10-16, 1 USD = 6.87 DKK.

## Copenhagen airport and transportation

The airport is conveniently located on the very edge of Denmark.

After getting to the main airport entrance, there are plenty of options for travel displayed: bus, metro, train, taxi.

Live update boards showing public transportation times are everywhere. The track numbers are also labelled so it's easy to match the board's signage with where to go.

(Small and large) city passes can be bought at airport kiosks. Alternatively, there is an app that allows buying many more types of city passes. More city passes below.

There are also single use tickets if you're not planning to use public transport more than once or twice.

### City pass

The city pass is great for visitors who need accessible public transportation for a short period of time.

There is also the Copenhagen Card which is more expensive but covers 2 children <12yo and gives (single use) entrance to many attractions.

### Things about the city I didn't know until I showed up

Trains can be that quiet?

Things open late and close early, most are 10am-6pm.

Related to above, do not assume you have time to go places! Rain can just happen and ruin all your plans like mine for souvenir shopping ðŸ˜­

Bikes have first class support. Many places downtown allow bikes but not cars. Bike storage lanes are everywhere.

Those pedestrian lights are cursed. There are _no_ indicators of when to not cross. They will be green and turn red with no warning. Car lights get a "warning" light before red turns to green. The single pedestrian light countdown I saw went down from 60 seconds and cycled between green and red multiple times. Who designed them like this??

There's a strange obsession with all you can eat fried pork.

Uber does not exist in Denmark because unions chased them out. They will be reintroduced in a few years under unionization.

Restaurant service is really bad (unless it's a $$$$$ place or it's closing time and they want to kick you out). I've never seen people so content to just let us chill at the table and not take our money.

Sparkling water is common to serve in restaurants.

## Pretty pictures and commentary

### Vibing at citizenM

The doorknobs! They do nothing!

citizenM is what happens when combining Ikea minimalism with pretty colors.

An iPad controls many aspects of the room, including TV, lights, blinds, and temperature.

Their buffet is stacked but expensive.

The shower controls are A+: temperature controls are decoupled from shower knobs. Get the perfect temperature every time.
